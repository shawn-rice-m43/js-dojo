Dynamic Programming: Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

// [{val: 1, weight: 10}, { val: 25, weight: 5 }];
maxJoy([1, 25], [10, 5], 10) => 25
maxJoy([60, 100, 120], [10, 20, 30], 50) => 220
