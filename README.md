# JS TDD Dojo

Round-robin code challenges with a focus on solving problems with Test-driven Development.

## Process

Driver and Navigator Pair Programming

> The Driver is the person at the wheel, i.e. the keyboard. She is focused on completing the tiny goal at hand, ignoring larger issues for the moment. A driver should always talk through what she is doing while doing it.
>
> The Navigator is in the observer position, while the driver is typing. She reviews the code on-the-go, gives directions and shares thoughts. The navigator also has an eye on the larger issues, bugs, and makes notes of potential next steps or obstacles.

Red => Green => Refactor

1. Write a test that asserts something about your code.
2. Write code that causes the test to pass.
3. Repeat until the problem is completely solved.

## Goals

- give each participant an opportunity to hone their problem solving skills in a supportive environment
- increase each participant's comfort level writing code in front of others
- give each participant hands-on experience testing JavaScript/TypeScript

Please note: 'solving the problem' is conspicuously absent from this list. We do not fail as a group if we fail to solve the problem. An individual does not fail if they don't write a passing test.
