# JS TDD Dojo

Round-robin code challenges with a focus on solving problems with Test-driven Development.

## Process

1 Driver 1 Passenger

The Driver writes the code. The Passenger suggests what to write.

Red => Green => Refactor

1. Write a test that asserts something about your code.
2. Write code that causes the test to pass.
3. Repeat until the problem is completely solved.

## Goals

- give each participant an opportunity to hone their problem solving skills in a supportive environment
- increace each participants comfort level writing code in front of others
- give each participant hands-on experience testing JavaScript

Please note: 'solving the problem' is conspicuously absent from this list. We do not fail as a group if we fail to solve the problem. An individual does not fail if they don't write a passing test.
